WebParty - Watch Together Project Description
Overview
WebParty is a real-time web application designed for users to watch videos together, communicate via chat, and engage in voice/video interactions within synchronized virtual rooms. The platform allows users to create private or public rooms,
 share video URLs (e.g., YouTube, direct MP4/WebM links), and broadcast playback to all participants in real-time. It leverages WebSockets for real-time communication, WebRTC for voice and video, and modern web technologies for a seamless user experience.

Features
Real-Time Video Synchronization: Users can share and synchronize video playback (e.g., YouTube, direct video files) across all participants in a room, controlled by the room creator (leader).
Real-Time Messaging: Participants can send and receive chat messages instantly within the room using WebSocket-based communication.
Voice and Video Communication: Real-time peer-to-peer audio and video streaming using WebRTC, allowing users to see and hear each other during sessions.
Room Management:
Create private or public rooms with unique IDs.
Join existing rooms by entering a room ID.
View a list of current participants in the room.
Leader-Based Control: Only the room creator (leader) can initiate and control video playback, ensuring synchronized viewing for all users.
Draggable Participants: Video participant tiles are draggable for better user positioning and layout customization.
Responsive Design: The interface is designed to work on desktops, with a clean, dark-themed UI using CSS and Material Icons for visual appeal.
Technical Details
Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6 modules).
Uses the YouTube Iframe API for YouTube video playback.
Supports direct video playback (MP4, WebM, OGG) and iframe embeds (e.g., pCloud links).
Leverages WebSocket for real-time data exchange and WebRTC for media streams.
Backend: A WebSocket server (not included in this repository but required) handles real-time communication (e.g., video synchronization, chat, peer connections). The server can run locally (ws://127.0.0.1:5000) or on a production environment (e.g., wss://webparty-1.onrender.com).
